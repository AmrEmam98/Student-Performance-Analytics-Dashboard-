# Student-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard
in this repo, we built a dashboard that analyzes the student performance based o some features like :
parent level of education 
Student food 
Race of students 
from the dashboard we can see some insights :
we compare the distribution of scores of students based on gender and we noticed that:

male students tend to get a higher score in math 

female students tend to get higher scores in writing and reading 

we compare the avg scores per  parent level of education and we noticed that :
students whose parents have master's degrees have the highest average scores

students whose parents have high school  have the lowest average scores 


from the scatter plot we see that :
there's a very strong relationship between writing and reading scores 


and there are many insights you can see while interacting with the dashboard and display different features
