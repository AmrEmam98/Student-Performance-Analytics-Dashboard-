in this repo, we built a dashboard that analyzes the student performance based o some features like :
parent level of education 
Student food 
Race of students 
from the dashboard we can see some insights :
we compare the distribution of scores of students based on gender and we noticed that:
male students tend to get a higher score in math 
female students tend to get higher scores in writing and reading 

we compare the avg scores per  parent level of education and we noticed that :
students whose parents have master's degrees have the highest average scores 
students whose parents have high school  have the lowest average scores 

from the scatter plot we see that :
there's a very strong relationship between writing and reading scores 

finally, the dashboard is responsive and you can try it yourself and tell us the insights you have seen
